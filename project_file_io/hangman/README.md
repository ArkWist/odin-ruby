# Hangman

A command line Hangman game. Chooses a word from a dictionary, and lets you guess letters until you win or make too many wrong guesses. Progress can be saved or loaded in local files.

I wrote this to practice Ruby as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.
