# Caesar Cipher

Takes a string and an offset, and returns the string with all the letters offset by the specified number of letters. I wrote this to practice Ruby as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

See **[Projects: Ruby Building Blocks](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/building-blocks)** for more information.

### What I learned

I learned about .ord and .chr. I was also happy to come up with a straightforward solution for dealing with large offsets (offsets greater than the range of letters---in this case 26 for the alphabet).
