# Bubble Sort

Takes a string of values and sorts them using the bubble sort algorithm. I wrote this to practice Ruby as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

See **[Projects: Advanced Building Blocks](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/advanced-building-blocks)** for more information.

### What I learned

I learned the most common sort algorithms and their pros/cons back in high school, so this was just practice for impelenting one of the easier ones in Ruby.
