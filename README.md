# Substrings

Takes a sentence and a dictionary of words, and prints a hash for how many times each word in the dictionary shows up in the sentence. I wrote this to practice Ruby as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

See **[Projects: Ruby Building Blocks](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/building-blocks)** for more information.

### What I learned

I learned about string#scan, which is very useful!
