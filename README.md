# Tic-Tac-Toe

A command line Noughts and Crosses game. One or both players can be set to human or AI controlled (haven't written the AI yet). The board size can be set from to 3x3 to 9x9.

I wrote this to practice Ruby as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

See **[Project: OOP with Ruby](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop)** for more information.
